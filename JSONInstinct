"FAQ":"Common Issues:\n\nQ: How do I apply any enchantment to anything\nA: Go to Enchantments and click Experimental All Enchant while holding something with a postive item ID. Then interact with the item by either putting it in a crafting table, breaking a block, or hitting an entity. Then, go back to the Enchantments list and press the button again, and move the item to your in-inventory crafting table. Done.\n\nQ: How do I report a bug?\nA: Contact me through Discord @ v7thSharkv#0101 or through the feedback option at instinctmods.com\n\nQ: How often are updates?\nA: Updates could be released once a week, every couple days, or longer.
