"FAQ":"Common Issues:\n\nQ: Why does the launcher hang when I try to open the Waypoints tab?\nA: This happens when the script has been altered. Press the 'Wipe Data' button in the 'Settings' tab and restart the launcher.\n\nQ: How do I hack items into realms?\nA: Go to the survival tab, tap 'Set Offhand', then enter the item ID and the amount. Tap 'Add' then move the item from your offhand to your hotbar.\n\nQ: My enchantments don't stay on the item, why?\nA: You have to enchant the item in your hand, then move the item to a crafting table. There's a crafting section in your inventory, move the newly enchanted item there.\n\nQ: The 'Rename' mod doesn't work, why?\nA: Use the rename mod then do the same thing as when you'd enchant an item. Put the item in the crafting section of your inventory.\n\nQ: Why does the button say it's locked?\nThis means you're either not connected to the internet or are on an outdated version of Instinct. Download the latest version.\n\nQ: How do I crash realms?\nA: Well, don't, people pay for those to be online. There are ways such as using a spawner and the spawn egg 383:83. Anybody in range will crash.\n\nQ: My launcher keeps crashing, how come?\nA: Try to not run too many mods at once. For instance, running the mod 'Hud' for too long will crash the game, it's meant to only be used for no more than a minute. Trying to use some mods while not in game will also crash the game.\n\nQ: Can people see me as a pig when I morph?\nA: No, these morphs are clientside only, meaning to everyone else, you'll look like a regular player.\nQ: Can you make me a custom client?\nA: Not for free.\n\nQ: Why is this client so much larger than others?\nA: My client is much larger than others online today, and mine has images. All this takes up space, the images are about 2.17mb alone.\n\nQ: Why is my client saying it isn't official?\nA: If you edit too much code, the client will detect this. Redownload the file from an official source.",
